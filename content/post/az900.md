# Module 1: Azure Cloud Concepts

> Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services ( like compute, networking, storage, analytics, databases, AI, DevOps, IoT, etc. ) over internet, enabling faster innovation, flexible resources and economies of scale.
>

> Serverless computing is ****a cloud-native development model that allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage servers.
>

## Cloud Models

- Public Cloud [ off-premises ]
    - Owned by cloud services or hosting provider.
    - Provides resources and services to multiple organizations and users.
    - Accessed via secure network connection (typically over the internet).

- Private Cloud [ on-premises ]
    - Organizations create a cloud environment in their data center.
    - Infrastructure is dedicated to a single user organization.
    - Organization is responsible for operating the services they provide.
    - Does not provide access to users outside of the organization.
    - Can be hosted at organization’s data center or via a cloud provider who offers private cloud hosting services.

- Hybrid Cloud
    - Combines *Public* and *Private* clouds to allow applications to run in the most appropriate location.

### **Cloud model comparison**

**Public Cloud**

- No capital expenditures to scale up.
- Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned.
- Organizations pay only for what they use.

**Private Cloud**

- Hardware must be purchased for start-up and maintenance.
- Organizations are responsible for maintenance and updates.
- Organizations have complete control over resources and security.

**Hybrid Cloud**

- Provides the most flexibility.
- Organizations determine where to run their applications.
- Organizations control security, compliance or legal requirements.

## Cloud Benefits and Considerations

### **Benefits of the cloud**

- High Availability
    - No apparent downtime, even when things go wrong.
- Agility
    - Deploy and configure cloud-based resources quickly as your application requirements change.
- Scalability
    - Applications in the cloud can scale vertically and horizontally.
    - Although it won’t reduce or remove the resources.
- Elasticity
    - Auto-scaling/Dynamic scalability to increase or reduce the resources as required.
- Fault tolerance
    - can operate continuously without interruption even when one or more of system’s components is in failure.
- Global reach
    - Cloud computing allows businesses to operate from multiple regions around the world.

### Consideration between Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx)

**Capital Expenditure - CapEx**

- The up-front spending of money on physical infrastructure.
- Costs of CapEx have a value that reduces over time.

**Operational Expenditure - OpEx**

- The Spending and Billing of products or services as needed.
- Expenses are deducted in the same year.

---

**Consumption-based Model**

Cloud Service Providers operate on a consumption-based model which means that end users pay only for the resources that they use. Whatever they use to what they pay for.

- Better cost prediction
- Prices for individual resources and services are provided
- Billing is based on actual usage

---

## Cloud Services

- Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)

    Build pay-as-you-go IT infrastructure by renting servers, virtual machines, storage, networks and Operating Systems from a cloud provider.

- Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

    Cloud Service Provider provides environment for building, testing and deploying software applications, without focusing on managing underlying infrastructure.

- Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)

    Users connect to and use cloud-based applications over the internet. Example : Microsoft 365 email and calendars.

    > There are some cloud services which are not covered in syllabus : like DaaS, Desktop-as-a-Service
    >

### Cloud Service Comparison

**IaaS**

- The most flexible cloud service.
- You configure and manage the hardware for your application.

**PaaS**

- Focus on application development.
- Platform management is handled by the cloud provider.

**SaaS**

- Pay-as-you-go pricing model.
- Users pay for the software they use on a subscription model.

### Serverless Computing

**Azure Functions**

- Azure Functions is a cloud service that provides all the continually updated infrastructure and resources needed to run your applications.
- You can use Functions to build web APIs, respond to database changes, process IoT streams, manage message queues, and more.

**Azure Logic Apps**

- Azure Logic Apps is a cloud service that helps you to create and run automated workflows that integrate your apps, data, services, and systems.
- With this platform, you can quickly develop highly scalable integration solutions for your enterprise and business-to-business (B2B) scenarios.

> With serverless computing applications, the cloud service provider automatically provisions, scales, and manages the infrastructure required to run the code.
